# Lc1
I need your help! (2/26/18): 
For now, please collect any chess engine games you can find and post a download link in (POST GAME LINKS HERE) High Quality Games Link.

NOTE 2: 
I was thinking, perhaps Lc1 can just be the codename for the project. The NN itself can be named something special like "AlphaOne" or something like that. 

I cannot focus on Lc1 due to IRL. So Lc1 will likely make no progress without help from others. Thanks!

What is Lc1?
Lc1 will take the non-zero approach to produce the strongest chess entity possible
