I need your help! (2/26/18): 
For now, please collect any chess engine games you can find and post a download link in (POST GAME LINKS HERE) High Quality Games Link.

NOTE 2: 
I was thinking, perhaps BetaOne can just be the codename for the project. The NN itself can be named something special like "AlphaOne" or something like that. (3/9/18 Renamed to BetaOne!)

What is BetaOne?
BetaOne will take the non-zero approach to produce the strongest chess entity possible
